## MLG2ProRS485

Connecting and communicating to a MLG-2 Pro device with serial interface RS 485

### Description

This sample shows how to connect to a MLG-2 Pro device with serial interface RS 485.
Measuring data is received.

### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated and thus might not work properly with the newest version of SICK AppStudio.

This sample can be run on any AppSpace device which contain a serial interface
RS 485, e.g. SIM family. The MLG-2 Pro device with a serial interface must be properly
connected to a serial port of the AppSpace device. If a device is powered over
the serial port of the AppSpace device the LED of the port is turned on. If data
is sent or received on the serial interface the LED of the port blinks.
